B0 Compiler Package
(c) Darran Kartaschew 2000-2006

Released under a BSD licence.

This package contains the b0 compiler and basic libraries needed
to produce linux 64bit (x86_64) or Windows x64 based applications. 
The compiler must be compiled from source code before it can be used.

(A 32bit version for i386 systems can also be built, by either
running 'make b0-ia32' or uncommenting #define i386 in ./src/b0.c).

Pre-requisites:
b0 only requires gcc 3.x and glibc (Development packages). Most
Linux distro's have these installed by default. GNU Make is 
also needed to compile the compilers source, but you can build
it manually if you so desire.

For Windows XP x64, you'll need VC++ and GNU Make, or if you don't 
have GNU Make, then you'll need to compile it manually, see 
./doc/b0.html for further instructions.

To install (linux):
>$ make
>$ su -c "make install"
>$ make clean

To install (Windows):
> make -f Makefile.w32
> make -f Makefile.w32 install
> make -f Makefile.w32 clean

Then add the environment variable B0_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/b0
eg.
>$ SET B0_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/b0

or alternatively within ~/.profile add:

export B0_INCLUDE="/usr/local/include/b0"

and for Windows:
1. Right-click 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'
2. Select 'Advanced' Tab and 'Environment Variables'
3. Add it in under 'User'.

To Uninstall (as root):
># make uninstall

Once installed, runtime configuration can be viewed by
>$ man b0

A pdf manual can be built, however requires html2ps and Ghostscript
to be installed, and therefore is not created by default. 
Note: The manual is provided as html by default, and is found in the
./doc directory. To make a pdf version of the user manual type
>$ make docs

The file 'b0.pdf' will be created, which can be viewed with any pdf 
viewer. 

The following examples are provided:

1. le.b0   -- Basic ELF64 executable. 
2. le2.b0  -- ELF64 executable providing UTF8 output test.
3. le3.b0  -- ELF64 Object test.
4. le4.b0  -- (le4_p1.b0 and le4_p2.b0) ELF64 linking multiple b0 object files.
5. le5.b0  -- ELF64 test linking with glibc.
6. le6.b0  -- ELF64 executable using UTF8 as internal string format.
7. le7.b0  -- Accessing argc and argv on Linux systems.
              Build using: make test
                           ./le
                           ./le2
                           ./le3
                           ./le4
                           ./le5
                           ./le6
						    ./le7

6. win64.b0 -- Windows x64 Demo program.
              Build using: b0 -fpe win64.b0
                           fasm win64.asm win64.exe
                           ./win64

7. gtk-cal.b0  -- Linux GTK v1.2 demo program. 
8. gtk2-cal.b0 -- Linux GTK v2.0 demo program.
              (located in ./examples/gtk)
              Build using: cd example/gtk
                           make
                           ./gtk-cal & ./gtk2-cal &

9. cgi1.b0  -- ELF64 based cgi for Linux based web-servers.
              Build using: b0 -felf -utf8 cgi1.b0
                           fasm cgi.asm b0.cgi
                           cp b0.cgi /var/www/cgi-bin (or cgi enabled
                                  directory for your web server).
                           Open Firefox and goto:
                                  http://localhost/cgi-bin/b0.cgi
                                  (replace localhost with your webaddress).
								  
10. IA-32 (aka i386) Examples can be found in ./examples/ia_32
